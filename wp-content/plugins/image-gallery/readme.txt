A simple image gallery with a crossfade effect

== Description ==

This is a simple image gallery which will automatically rotate through a list of given images/links, and crossfade through each of them randomly before rotating back to start.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `img-gallery.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in wordpress
3. Place the widget into the sidebar on your site through the 'Widgets' menu
